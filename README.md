# CricketMonteCarlo
The following repository runs a monte carlo simulation of the cricket card game to determine 
various statistics about the game over millions of simulations. The statistics include:
1. Median runs scored in an innings.
2. Number of Centuries(100 runs) scored throughout all trials.
3. Number of Ducks(0 runs) throughout all trials.
4. Number of Half-Centuries(50 runs) throughout all trials.

You can check the rules here- https://www.pagat.com/invented/cricket_card.html

However the version of cricket simulated in this program, is a simpler ( and more popular ) version of the game. 
In this version, the suits of the cards are irrelevant, and all cards have equal value.

All the python code is present in the repository, along with the graphed results for all the simulations!
